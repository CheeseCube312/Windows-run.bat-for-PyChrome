# Windows-run.bat-for-PyChrome-V8
This is the .bat file for reddit user u/KlutzyAd8521's PyChrome V8 image editing tool. For attribution and copyright reasons I do not include the actual program. Hope KlutzyAd8625 will add the project to Github so I can just add it to the project properly.

# Steps:
1. If you don't have it yet, download and Install Python* (important: check "Install to PATH" during the installation)
2. Open Google-Drive link
3. Download "OPEN SOURCE Py-Chrome V8.py" 
4. Download "Examples photos to try"-folder (optional, but recommended for testing)
5. Download the .bat file from the Github release-page 
6. Create a folder, place the 3 files inside.
7. Unpack "Examples photos to try.zip"
8. Click run.bat

Everything should just install. After that all the stuff from the guide applies. :)

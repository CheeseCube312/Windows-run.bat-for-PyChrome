# Windows run.bat for PyChrome (Updated)

This is the updated .bat launcher for reddit user u/KlutzyAd8521's PyChrome image editing tool. This version works with the new folder structure and main script (app.py), and expects the code to be in the "Source Code" folder.

## Resources
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [PyChromeV8 Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/infraredphotography/comments/1qjqp9l/an_indepth_guide_to_pychrome_v8/)

## Steps
1. If you don't have it yet, download and install Python (important: check "Add Python to PATH" during installation).
2. Download the PyChrome source code and place it in a folder with the following structure:
	- `Source Code/app.py` 
3. (Optional) Download example photos for testing.
4. Place the updated `run.bat` in the main project folder (next to the `Source Code` folder).
5. Double-click `run.bat` to launch PyChrome. The script will set up a virtual environment and install dependencies if needed.

Everything should install and run automatically. After that, refer to the guide for usage instructions.
